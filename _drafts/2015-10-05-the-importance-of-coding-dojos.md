excerpt: Our team started to create coding dojo's, and here's my thoughts about it...
---
And so, our team came, some months ago, with the idea of doing coding dojo's.

My first thought about it was: what the heck is a coding dojo?

After a quick research, I've realized that coding dojo is like a meeting, where the main purpose is: to code.

Then, I said: but, I mean, we already do this... everyday... on our machines.

But the purpose is a little bit different: the objective is to join everybody to solve a specific problem, and more: everybody must write code. The guy who's coding is changed time after time, allowing everybody to give its 5 cents on the project.

Said so, my first questions was:

1. Isn't that some kind of pair programming?

2. Why everybody must code? Can't we elect a coder and the others just opinate about the development?

3. This is going to be a completely mess...

But OK. We're a team, so let's give a try on this...

And, after the first session of coding dojo, I can resume this in one single world: **Amazing**.
