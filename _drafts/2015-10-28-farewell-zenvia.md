excerpt: This is my last month at Zenvia, and I have something to say about it...
---
Well, after 8 months working here at [Zenvia][zenvia-website], I'm leaving my current position for the constant search of new challenges and knowledge, this time at [Codeminer42][codeminer-website].

Maybe it seems like a short amount of time to understand how a company works, and it's in fact. But, in these 8 months, I've learned more than I have learned in my whole life as a software developer.

I remember quite well when I've arrived here at [Zenvia][zenvia-website]:

Scared as hell, afraid of not reaching the expected technical level required to work in VAS ([__Value Added Service__][vas-wiki]) and all the other demons that fly around a developer's head when moving to a new company. And, in fact, the whole VAS architecture is huge, and a lot of patterns must be followed in order to keep everything running well. And, the majority of these patters were not familiar to me.

However, even as I was being thrown in this sea of new technologies and methodologies, I found people who were open to help me and guide me through this ecosystem. And more: they've taught me how to develop with quality and focusing not only in release speed, but mainly in **quality**.

I remember that, when I started here, my knowledge in automated tests were basic, specially because I've come from companies where automated tests were so basic or even inexistent. Now, after 8 months of [Zenvia][zenvia-website], I'm much more critic about software quality and focusing not only on release speed, but mainly in **quality**.

> A code without tests is like hydrogen: everything seems to be OK right now, but a single miss step and everything explodes.

It's kind of funny to think that, 8 months ago, I was afraid of writing automated tests, and now I'm doing TDD, which basically is write your tests before any code :P

Here at [Zenvia][zenvia-website], I found more than a tech company, with a huge amount of data processed everyday. I found a family, a place where nobody is just an ordinary employee, but first of all, a friend, someone who you can trust deeply, who you care for like a family member and who you're happy to hang out with on weekends or drink a beer after office hours.

The company is responsible, in a great part, for this awesome environment, by understanding that the employee's happiness is directly proportional to its productivity.

> A happy employee is an efficient employee

To finish this post, a company is formed by people, and these people have the power to create an environment that welcome every new member and make him feel comfortable and enjoy working there, as I did.

So, I thank every single person in [Zenvia][zenvia-website] for this awesome experience, and leave the company with the complete feel that this was the best company I've ever worked so far.

Some guys deserve a special thank you:

- [Rafael Garbin][garbin-linkedin];
- [Thiago Ghilardi][ghilardi-linkedin];
- [Tiago Oliveira][oliveira-linkedin];
- [Arthur Schuch][artur-linkedin];

Life goes on and I'm anxious to meet my new coworkers at [Codeminer42][codeminer-website], expecting to have an awesome experience, like the one I had here at [Zenvia][zenvia-website].
