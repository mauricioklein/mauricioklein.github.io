excerpt: <i>docker-compose run</i> isn't forwarding ports? Check here how to fix it.

Docker is a great tool to create a self-contained environment to run your applications, dealing easily with the problems of package dependencies and other stuff that bothers every software developer.

However, generally, an application depends of other resources, like database, cache or even other applications.

To solve this problem, docker provides the <i>docker-compose</i> command, that handles all system dependencies.

Generally, to lift an entire environment, a simple <i>docker-compose up</i> is enough. However, sometimes, we want to run a specific command in a starting container.

For example:

Let's suppose we have the following <i>docker-compose.yml</i> file:

{% gist mauricioklein/e40cfdbbda912f59c311 docker-compose.yml %}

Running...

{% highlight sh %}
docker-compose run api bash
{% endhighlight %}

... will start the environment described in <i>docker-compose.yml</i>, executing an interactive bash in the container labelled as <i>api</i>.

The problem comes when we do a port forward. By default, <i>docker-compose run</i> doesn't forward its ports. It isn't a bug, but its default behavior, as described in [Docker's official documentation][docker-compose-run-docs].

To overcome this behavior, <i>docker-compose run</i> provides the <b>--service-ports</b> parameter, which enables port forwarding in <i>docker-compose run</i>.

So, our previous command becomes something like this:
{% highlight sh %}
docker-compose run --service-ports api bash
{% endhighlight %}

Now, all the required port forwarding described in <i>docker-compose.yml</i> will in fact be forwarded.

(PS: Thanks to [Tiago Oliveira][tiago-page] for helping me to figure it out)
