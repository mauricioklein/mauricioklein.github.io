Well, 2015 is ending and, surely, I can say that this year was awesome.

First of all, on march, I got married with the most beautiful and amazing girl in the world. The wedding party was awesome, except the epic hangover I got the next day :P
Besides that, it was a memorable moment, and the beginning of a great year.

Right after the marriage, one week later to be more specific, I started working at Zenvia.
There, I found people that quickly moved from former coworkers to real good friends.
I was in touch with the latest technologies in market, helping to improve many products with a huge load, and this was a real carrer boost.

A couple of months later, a new family member arrived: Elliot, our second dog.
He arrived here as a tiny yellow ball, almost the same size of a tenis ball.
Now, 6 months later, his is bigger than Clementine (our first dog), but the mental age stays the same: a little boy, with a huge amount of energy in a big body, which becomes him in a out of control truck :P

![Yeah, it grew up... A LOT][elliot-photo]

Once again, I got engaged at gym with former Zenvia coworkers.
This was giving a really good results: loss weight and gained muscles.
This stood 3 months longer, but the objective remains untouched and I will be back in the first week of January.

After 8 months at Zenvia, a got a better job oportunity, at Codeminer42.
It was really tough for me to leave a company that I loved working in and leave great people and friends I gained there.

But I was blessed in Codeminer42 as well, because I found amazing people there too.
My first project is to help improve UOL's Pagseguro Sandbox.
In both Codeminer42 and UOL, I'm working with fully skilled guys, which is improving my technical and interpersonal skills day by day.
Also, I'm having the chance of work in one of the most respectable brazillian Ruby companies.

So, I can just say thank you for everyone who made part of this amazing year.
All of you is responsable for all the experiences and knowledges I adquired this year.
Some personnal projects weren't achieved this year (loss weight, specially), but they remains in my roadmap.

So, I wish you all the best in 2016, and expect that the new year brings more and more good feelings, amazing people, great projects and everything that makes a happy programmer :)
